              <p>Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</p>
              <p>Hey, guess what you're accessories to. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Bender, this is Fry's decisionâ€¦ and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
